 * declared by the actual packages there are some packages where you only really want one of
 * and thus they are declared as peer dependencies â€“ react / styled-components / etc.
 *
 * If these deps are not installed or declared, then we prompt the user to correct this. In
 * V4 this is not a hard requirement, but in V5 it will be. Might as well get people started now.
