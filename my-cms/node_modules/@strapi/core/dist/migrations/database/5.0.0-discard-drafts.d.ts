/**
 * This migration is responsible for creating the draft counterpart for all the entries that were in a published state.
 *
 * In v4, entries could either be in a draft or published state, but not both at the same time.
 * In v5, we introduced the concept of document, and an entry can be in a draft or published state.
 *
 * This means the migration needs to create the draft counterpart if an entry was published.
 *
 * This migration performs the following steps:
 * 1. Creates draft entries for all published entries, without it's components, dynamic zones or relations.
 * 2. Using the document service, discard those same drafts to copy its relations.
