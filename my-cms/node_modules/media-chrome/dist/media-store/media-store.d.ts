/**

 * MediaStore is a way to model media state (and changes to it) in a framework- and DOM-agnostic way. Like the difference between Redux
 * (the core state manager) and the Redux react wrapper, MediaStore provides the primitive for aggregating media state together in one place.
 *
 * It receives events as media state change requests (like `mediaplayrequest`) and keeps an internal representation of the complete media
 * state after they change, as opposed to querying the media state sources directly every time it needs to check what state something is in.
 *
 * It doesn't "know" how to update or query the StateOwners itself (like the media element). Rather, it relies on the StateMediator as an interface
 * for getting and setting state and relies on the RequestMap as an interface for translating state change requests to state updates (typically also
 * deferring to the StateMediator for setting state on the relevant StateOwners).
 *
 * Additionally, MediaStore state is not optimistically stored when a state change request is dispatched to it. It instead defers to the StateMediator,
 * waiting for events from the StateOwners before checking if the state actually changed and only then committing it to its internal representation of MediaState.
 *

/**
 * MediaStore is the primary abstraction for managing and monitoring media state and other state relevant to the media UI
 * (for example, fullscreen behavior or the availability of media-related functionality for a particular browser or runtime, such as volume control or Airplay). This includes:
 * - Keeping track of any state changes (examples: Is the media muted? Is the currently playing media live or on demand? What audio tracks are available for the current media?)
 * - Sharing the latest state with any MediaStore subscribers whenever it changes
 * - Receiving and responding to requests to change the media or related state (examples: I would like the media to be unmuted. I want to start casting now. I want to switch from English subtitles to Japanese.)
 * - Wiring up and managing the relationships between media state, media state change requests, and the stateful entities that “own” the majority of this state (examples: the current media element being used, the current root node, the current fullscreen element)
 * - Respecting and monitoring changes in certain optional behaviors that impact state or state change requests (examples: I want subtitles/closed captions to be on by default whenever media with them are loaded. I want to disable keeping track of the user’s preferred volume level.)

 * const unsubscribe = mediaStore.subscribe(state => {
 *   myToggleMutedButton.textContent = state.muted ? 'Unmute' : 'Mute';
 * });
