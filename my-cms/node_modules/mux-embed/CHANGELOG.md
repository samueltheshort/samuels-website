### Patch Changes

- 117d668: fix an issue where seeking time before first play attempt counted towards video startup time

## 5.0.0

### Major Changes

- 70b87d4: Add opt-in TypeScript Types to Mux Embed and use + refactor for other dependent data SDKs. Update published dists to include CJS and ESM.
- Mux Embed now provides (opt in) TypeScript types in its published package, as well as publishes CJS and ESM versions of the package.
- This allows us to provide a lower risk and iterative roll out of official TypeScript types for `mux-embed`. The export types updates were required to ensure actual matches between the dist package and corresponding TypeScript types.
- This _should_ have no direct impact on users, though different build tools will now potentially select one of the new export types (e.g. the ESM "flavor" of `mux-embed`). TypeScript types _should not_ be applied unless they are explicitly referenced in app (discussed in docs updates).
