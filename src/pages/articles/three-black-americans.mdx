While doing historical research, you sometimes come across little gems. I recently came across an article in the Jackson Advocate of 22 July 1944, titled 3 Signal Corpsmen Capture 15 Germans in Short Order, that I wanted to share with you.
## Army Serice Forces 
During the Second World War, the American Army was segregated. Units were established based upon race and black Americans predominately served in support units. The Signal Corps is part of the Army Service Forces and many black Americans served in these units. Since they were often relegated to second-line duties, the black Americans infrequently encountered enemies in their line of duty.

## Infrequently in Combat
An exception happened in June or July 1944 in France, where three linesmen captured 15 Germans. Although it’s a minor encounter in the course of the war, it gives a glimpse into the experiences of black American soldiers during the Second World War. The article is added in its entirety below.

## 3 Signal Corpsmen Capture 15 Germans in Short Order

### WITH ALLIED FORCES IN FRANCE (ANP)
The capture of 15 Germans by three [black Americans] of the army signal corps recently rates as the foremost news of this section. Those involved in the capture were Cpl. Bernard P. Henderson, 28, of New York City; Cpl. Percy E. Cox, Jr., 28, Petersburg, Va.; and Cpl. Allie W. Campbell, 26, Planes, Virginia.  
  When Cpl. Cox, who is a linesman, went to the top of a 30-foot pole to do a repair job, he happened to look down, he saw a German helmet moving in the bushes beneath him. Cox lost no time reaching the ground. He described his decent down the pole as “Burning the pole.” When he reached the ground, he yelled to Henderson, who was 30 yards away. Henderson ran to where Cox stood, dropped and rolled over, at the same time pulling his carbine, a lesson he learned in basic training.  
  “There is a German there,” Cox shouted to Henderson, indicating the Nazi’s position by pointing his finger. Henderson began shooting where Cox pointed and the German popped up with his hands in the air. Henderson fired again and three more Germans jumped up, muttering something the boys could not understand: another shot brought three more Nazis: again Henderson fired, this time five Germans showed with upraised hands. The fifth and last shot brought the total surrender to 15, all looking frightened and pitiful.
### DRIVER COMES UP
By this time, Campbell, who was the truck driver, heard the shots. He grabbed his tommy gun and ran to where Cox and Henderson were.
Since they were out of ammunition, they were glad he lost no time in coming to their rescue. They told him what had happened and he immediately wanted to prowl for more Germans but they finally agreed to pack to 15 “Jerries” in the truck and take them to headquarters as quickly as possible.  
The boys had carried out their duties in excellent fashion. They had searched the prisoners and confiscated valuable papers. Henderson and Cox did guard duty while Campbell drove the prisoners to the provost office. The commanding officer was surprised to see the 15 Nazis being ushered into his presence. Lt. Charles A. Gray, Audubon, N. J., extended congratulations.
### PROUD OF MEN
“The three boys executed the act admirably,” said Lt. Gray, a platoon officer, “just as if they were infantry men and trained for the job. They acted like all soldiers should act and one of the dominating features of it was that they were not boastful.’’ Lt. Gray said he is extremely proud of the men in general for they are making an outstanding contribution to the cause.
The commanding officer, Major Thomas J. Quan, Worchesber, Mass., beamed with excitement. He is pleased at the distinction the three heroes brought to the battalion.  
Bernard P. Henderson is the son of a woman candidate for the 19th Assembly of New York, Mrs. Anna H. Hughes. Henderson’s wife, Mae, and daughter, Gloria, 6, are now in Washington, D. C. Before entering the army, the operated a switchboard at the Woodside Hotel in Manhattan. He is a graduate of Cooper Junior High School. 
Cpl. Percy E. Cox is the son of Mrs. Percy Cox of Petersburg, Va. He was employed by the Johnson Taxi company before he entered Peabody High School in Petersburg. A native of Plains, Va., 
Cpl. Allie W. Campbell is the son of Mrs. Lucille Campbell. He is a graduate of the Posters Fork Public school. All three are classified as linesmen and had broken up into sections when the capture of the 15 Germans occurred.
