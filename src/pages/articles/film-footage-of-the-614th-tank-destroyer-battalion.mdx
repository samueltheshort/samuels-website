eating chow.

## Finally found!

After a lot of research, I've managed to track down the appropriate reel and get it digitized. As far as I know, it's the only film footage showing soldiers of the 614th Tank Destroyer Battalion during the Second World War. The clip shows soldiers of the 614th Tank Destroyer Battalion lining a fox hole with straw, eating chow, digging a trench and guarding two reconnaissance M-20 Scout Cars. In between, there is a fragment showing soldiers of the 95th Infantry Divsion to which the 614th Tank Destroyer Battalion was attached at that time. The movie was made on 30 November 1944 in France.

## Watch it online!

The fragments featuring the soldiers of the 614th TD are available online.
