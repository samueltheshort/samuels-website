The past couple of weeks, I have not been as active as I have been before. I was on holiday in Greece together with some friends. The country was beautiful to visit and we saw many wondrous sights. Now that I’m back and have adjusted to the Dutch climate again, I’m making steady progress with the various projects.

## What has happened?
So the translation of C. J. Wagevier’s book, titled *Fighting for Napoleon's Army in Russia: A POW's Memoir* has appeared recently. In this book, Wagevier recounts his experiences with the 125th Regiment of the Line, which consisted of Dutch soldiers, during the disastrous Russian Campaign of 1812. It’s been a delight to work on this project! I hope readers have as much joy reading it as I had in translating it.
## What's to come?
Now, there are several projects coming up. I’m still working on the book titled *Tuskegee Airmen: Dogfighting with the Luftwaffe and Jim Crow*. These Black American pilots fought in the Mediterranean and Europe as part of the 332nd Fighter Group, while the 477th Bombardment Group had to confront Jim Crow at home. It will be published in February 2024. Lastly, I’m making steady progress with the book about the 452nd Anti-Aircraft Artillery Battalion. I came across some fascinating sources, which once again reminded me of the joys of historical research. 

I will keep you updated!
