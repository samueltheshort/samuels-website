*Title: The Dunwich horror  
Author: H. P. Lovecraft  
Published: 1929*  

The Dunwich horror was one of my first forays into the work of H.P. Lovecraft. I have read some other horror fiction before, but this was my first book set in the Cthulhu Mythos universe. I’ve read it recently and thoroughly enjoyed it!

## Wilbur Whateley
The story is set in Dunwich, a small village, where a mysterious child lives. He’s raised by his mother and his grandfather, Old Whateley. Old Whateley is a sorcerer and he teaches his grandchild about forbidden rituals. This child, Wilbur Whateley, ages rapidly and is shunned by the local inhabitants. The house that they live in is expanded several times and although the family often buys new animals, their herd never grows.  

## Alone in the House 
After the death of his family, Wilbur continues to live in the house alone. It becomes obvious there's more to him and the house than meets the eye. Wilbur eventually runs into some problems, but he does not have the appropriate tools to do so.

## The Dunwich Horror
Since a magical book is needed, Wilbur tries to acquire it legally through a library, but is unable to do so. Because of this, he tries to do it illegally and is killed in the process. At this point, the focus of the story shifts, centering on the efforts of three professors to uncover the mysterious origins of Wilbur Whateley and the strange events surrounding the family’s house in Dunwich. Eventually it turns out that an invisible monster lives in the house, which escapes and rampages around the countryside, before confronted by the three professors and a local posse. As for how this ends, you’ll have to read the book yourself. 

## Available on Project Gutenberg
The story is quick and fun to read. Lovecraft masterfully sets the stage and knows well how to keep the reader engaged. You want to keep reading! Highly recommended to read for those interested in horror-mystery stories.  The story is available for free at Project Gutenberg.
