The past year I’ve been working on several projects. One of these projects, at which I’ve hinted several times, is the translation of Carel Jacob Wagevier’s memoir. As an officer in the Dutch 125th Regiment of the Line he joined the Russian campaign of 1812. During this campaign he fought in combat and was eventually taken prisoner.

The cover of the book

His captivity is marked with joy and sorrow, which he writes about diligently. He meets new friends, while losing several old ones. He’s a good observer and he writes eloquently about the sights and his experiences. It has been a fascinating book and it created the spark that eventually led to this translation. I strove to keep Wagevier’s voice as authentic as possible and I hope that the reader will derive as much joy from it as I had in creating this translation.
 
The book will published in June 2023, but if you are already excited, you can pre-order it on the site of [Pen and Sword](https://www.pen-and-sword.co.uk/Fighting-for-Napoleons-Army-in-Russia-Hardback/p/23465) already.
