## Thank you Netgalley and the Publisher
Through Netgalley I was given the chance to read an advance copy in exchange for an honest review. My Life Among Humans is a humorous graphic novel. It provides a quick and entertaining read. It’s an endearing story and I greatly enjoyed reading it.

## An Alien Worker on Earth
An alien worker is sent to Earth to observe humans. It’s task is to report back to its manager, which wants to have clean data. This eventually results in a dilemma, after the alien is discovered and takes over the subjects it is supposed to be observing. From this point on, the manager tries to cover up its error as well as to prevent the other humans from discovering its existence. Eventually, the manager arrives on Earth to discover what is going on.

## Alien Invader Horror Story
In a sense, it’s a classical ‘alien invader horror story’. An unknown force is slowly taking over people in a town and a small group of humans need to find out what is happening and prevent others from suffering a similar fate. The twist is that the story is observed from the point of view of the alien and that the alien has no hostile intent. It just wants to do its job and stay out of trouble.

## Pleasantly Surprised
Surprisingly, the comic has a depth that I had not expected at first. The alien has a larger background than anticipated. Another thing I liked was the humor! For example, when the alien tries to mimic being a human, it results in the necessary mistakes. There are some references to being a corporate employee and the accompanying issues that I could appreciate. It’s a easily accessible story and provides a light-hearted reading. 

Overall, I enjoyed reading this book.
