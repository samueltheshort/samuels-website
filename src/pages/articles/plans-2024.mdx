In between all that’s going on, I thought I’d chime in and let you all know what I am working on.

## February deadlines
As you’ll have noticed, I’m busy with several projects. In February the book about the Tuskegee Airmen appears. Furthermore, in February I need to hand in the manuscript for the book about the 452nd Anti-Aircraft Artillery Battalion. After that, there’s a bit of a lull, because once those two projects are wrapped up, things will calm down a bit.

## 777th Field Artillery Battalion
Of course, there are new projects coming up. I’m working on a book about the 777th Field Artillery Battalion. It’s another Black American unit that fought during the Second World War. I have no deadline yet, but once this project gets up and running, I expect things will proceed rapidly. 

That’s all for now!
