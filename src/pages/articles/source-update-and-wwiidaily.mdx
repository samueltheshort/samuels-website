History is full of surprises and sometimes these surprises come when you least expect them. As some of you might know, every day I post something on Instagram about Black American soldiers during the Second World War. I also collaborate with people and interact with what they post. Recently @worldwarII_daily posted a photograph, which caught my eye. I've added it below. Perhaps you can also spot it.

If not, once you zoom in, you can see that the hands that the hands of the man wearing the life preserver are a different color than those of the surrounding people. He's the man in the red circle. I was intruiged and dug a bit deeper, where I found another photograph. It’s mostlikely made by James L. Lonergan, who is seen standing up with the camera in the first photograph. He's the man in the yellow circle.

As you can see in the images below, the Coast Guardsman is a Black American.

This is the original image that James L. Lonergan took, which you can see in the first photograph.

              />

Whereas the discovery of this image doesn’t alter the perception of history, it’s once more a confirmation that Black Americans were there and the contribution of Black Americans during the Second World War.
