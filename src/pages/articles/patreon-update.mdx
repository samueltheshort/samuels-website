## Executive summary
Currently, there is a gap in the existing historiography. Black American soldiers are systematically ignored, forgotten, or tokenized. To acknowledge and address the contributions of these brave warriors, it is important to share the history of Black American soldiers during the Second World War. To do so costs time and money. You can help change changing this, for as little as $ 5.00 per month. With your support from a monthly contribution of $ 10.00 or more, you’ll be mailed every month a postcard featuring Black American soldiers during the Second World War, while also funding the research that I am doing.

## Who is Samuel de Korte? 
I've studied ‘Contemporary History of Modern Europe’ at Utrecht University in the Netherlands and wrote my MA thesis about the representation of Black American soldiers during the Second World War. Black American soldiers are underrepresented in contemporary history and I kept thinking about this fact. I want to help solve this problem.  
After having finished my studies, I made it my mission to raise awareness for Black American soldiers during the Second World War. They suffered from discrimination during enlistment, during their service, or afterward when they returned to civilian life. However, many Black soldiers, when presented with the opportunity, performed valiantly.  
I raise awareness for their contribution by writing about Black American units during World War Two, so that their efforts are not forgotten. Past projects include a book about the 614th Tank Destroyer Battalion (Finalist, 2022 Army Historical Foundation Distinguished Writing Awards), while upcoming projects include a book about the 452nd Anti-Aircraft Artillery Battalion and a book about the 777th Field Artillery Battalion.  
Digitized images, which are part of the research, have been made available online, such as photographs of the 76th Coast Artillery Regiment. Additional research discovered the unit history of the 969th Field Artillery Battalion, titled the Golden Cannon, which can be downloaded for free on my website and is thus publicly available or finding film footage of the 614th Tank Destroyer Battalion. He also discovered a photograph of Mack B. Anderson, thus providing a face to a true American hero. See [Appendix 1](#appendix-1-samuel-de-korte) for more information about me and my social media presence.  

## Why does this matter? 
Black American soldiers are often ignored or left out of the history of the Second World War, even though at that time around 10% of the US Army consisted of Black American soldiers. This is a serious problem because we cannot overcome historical injustices until we identify and address them. In part, this also contributes to problems experienced in US society today. There’s talk about history, but Black and white history is not the same. Even though Black and white soldiers served in the same war, they had vastly different experiences. By learning about their different experiences and different perspectives on the war, we can better understand the problems of the present. By raising awareness for all Black American units and their efforts during the war, we’re addressing that issue one postcard at a time.
 
## What is the money used for? 
The money is used to fund the research. This research consists of several components, time to do research and write, as well as money to do research. Sometimes historical images need to be digitized so that they can be made publicly available or archival documents need to be digitized to gain access to them. All of this costs money, which is where you can help. The income of the project will thus be used to fund further research as well as make time available to do this research. See [Appendix 2](#appendix-2-the-costs-of-doing-research) for some of the costs of research. If you wish to make a one-time or a monthly donation, click [here](https://www.patreon.com/samueldekorte). 

## What are the benefits of supporting this research? 
History is about sharing and I believe that I should make as much of the history available for free as possible. That’s why I uploaded the images of the 76th Coastal Artillery Regiment or shared the unit history of the 969th Field Artillery Battalion. I don’t like paywalls. The end goal should always be to make as much available for free as possible.  
By having an additional stream of revenue, I can spend more time researching and writing and being less reliant on my day job to fund the research. This allows everyone involved to raise awareness for Black American soldiers during the Second World War, which will lead to a better understanding of our historical differences and actively help create a better world.

## Why do you mail postcards? 
It’s an extra boost to raise awareness for the contribution of Black American soldiers during the Second World War. It’s done to thank the people who donate monthly $ 10.00 or more. They make it possible for me to do research and I want to share interesting images with them. Thus they receive a postcard every month featuring a reprinted photograph of Black American soldiers during the Second World War, while on the back of the postcard is a short explanation of the image featured on the other side. This will be sent to their home or the address that they provide. (Unless people wish to opt out.) See [Appendix 3](#appendix-3-examples-of-postcards) for two examples.

[Books](https://www.samueldekorte.com/books)  
Of special importance are the following two books:  
The 614th Tank Destroyer Battalion: Fighting on Both Fronts (2022)
Black American soldiers are consistently ignored or forgotten, while they did participate in the Second World War. Based upon archival material, other sources, and conversations with descendants, I wrote a book about one of the segregated American units.

Tuskegee Airmen: Dogfighting with the Luftwaffe and Jim Crow (2024)
During the Second World War, the Tuskegee Airmen had not one but two enemies to overcome: the German Luftwaffe and Jim Crow. In this book, the inspiring history of these men is recounted detailing the struggles the men faced at home and abroad.

Additionally, in 2025 a book on the history of the 452nd Anti-Aircraft Artillery will appear. 

Articles:  
Black Soldiers, the Second World War, and Historical Comic books: An Examination of Black American Soldiers in Comic Books about the Second World War, The Hellfighter, 2023
An examination of Black American soldiers in comic books. Two separate comic books are analyzed regarding their portrayal of Black American soldiers, their service, and their impact during the Second World War. This is then contrasted with their actual participation in order to gain a better understanding of the blind spots in contemporary popular culture. In this case, the comic books focus on action and exciting elements, forgoes the more complicated topics in American history, such as segregation and racism.
