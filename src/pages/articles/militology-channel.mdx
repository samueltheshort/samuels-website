## Militology
For the Militology channel on Youtube I write scripts about a variety of topics. One of the scripts, which I have written, is about the 614th Tank Destroyer Battalion. I'm proud of it and I wanted to share it with you. 

## The Militology Channel  
The Militology channel is dedicated to military history and explores past battles, weapons, tactics, generals and heroes throughout history. Among others, I've also written a script about [Doris Miller](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwyDvTeb2qY) and another one about the [Tuskegee Airmen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYBgbwqPDTA). 
## Watch it online!
The whole documentary is online and can be watched on Youtube!
