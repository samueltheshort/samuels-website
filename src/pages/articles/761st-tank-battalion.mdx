## The 761st Tank Battalion: The Black Panthers of World War II

The 761st Tank Battalion, famously known as the "Black Panthers," holds a distinguished place in the history of World War II as the first Black American tank unit to see combat. Activated in 1942, the battalion operated under the rallying cry “Come Out Fighting!”, a motto that reflected their determination to overcome not only the Axis powers but also the pervasive racism and segregation within the U.S. military.

Attached to General Patton’s Third Army, the 761st entered combat in November 1944 during the Lorraine Campaign in France. Their skill and resilience quickly earned them recognition as a formidable force. Over 183 days of continuous combat, the battalion played pivotal roles in major operations, including the relief of Bastogne during the Battle of the Bulge and the crossing of the Rhine River into Germany. Despite heavy losses, they consistently demonstrated exceptional bravery, tactical expertise, and discipline on the battlefield.  

## The Black Panthers
One of the battalion's most significant contributions was its ability to adapt to challenging conditions. Fighting in harsh winter weather and against entrenched German forces, the Black Panthers proved their mettle in both offensive and defensive operations. Their actions directly contributed to the liberation of towns, the capture of enemy strongholds, and the eventual defeat of Nazi Germany.  
Despite their exemplary service, the men of the 761st faced racism from their own ranks and were often denied the recognition they deserved. It wasn’t until 1978 that the battalion received a Presidential Unit Citation, honoring their extraordinary heroism. Notable members, such as Staff Sergeant Ruben Rivers, who was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his sacrifice. Other notable members include Warren Crecy, who was nicknamed “the baddest man in the 761st Tank Battalion”.

## Come Out Fighting
The legacy of the 761st Tank Battalion endures as a symbol of courage, determination, and the fight for equality. Their story reminds us of the critical contributions of Black soldiers in securing victory during World War II, even as they battled for their rightful place in history.

Part of securing their legacy comes from their unit history “Come Out Fighting”, which was written by Trezzvant Anderson. He was a reporter, who had covered a lot of the exploits of the 761st Tank Battalion. The book was published in 1945 and available online.
