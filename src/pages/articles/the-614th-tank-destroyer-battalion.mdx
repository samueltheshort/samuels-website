The 614th Tank Destroyer Battalion is one of the most outstanding Black American units to serve during World War II. Formed during an era of segregation in the U.S. Army, this battalion proved that valor, skill, and determination knew no racial boundaries. Their extraordinary accomplishments on the battlefield helped pave the way for the eventual desegregation of the military and solidified their place in the annals of African American military history.

Activated on 25 July 1942, the 614th Tank Destroyer Battalion was part of the U.S. Army’s broader strategy to counter the formidable German tank forces. The unit trained extensively in anti-tank warfare, mastering the use of their towed anti-tank guns. In August 1944, the battalion shipped to England and later to France. In November 1944, the battalion was attached to the 95th Infantry Division. The battalion soon experienced its first combat. During an engagement on 22 November 1944, Staff Sergeant Christopher J. Sturkey distinguished himself in combat. When the column of which he was a part was shelled by enemy artillery, he encouraged others to return to their vehicles and save the equipment. He was rewarded with the Silver Star Medal for his valor. In December 1944 the battalion was relieved of the 95th Infantry Division and attached to the 103d Infantry Division.

### The Battle of Climbach
The battalion’s defining moment came during its advance through Nazi-occupied Europe. On December 14, 1944, in the town of Climbach, France, the 614th achieved a remarkable victory against a heavily fortified German position. The taskforce, under command of Colonel Blackshear, consisted of a reinforced infantry company of the 411th Infantry Regiment, a platoon of tanks, and Third Platoon, Company C, of the 614th Tank Destroyer Battalion. As Sergeant Dillard Booker wrote about the engagement: "It was said that a new unit was not respected until it proves itself in battle. We were considered as such with the 103d Infantry Division, until the morning of Dec 14, 1944. Captain Charles Thomas, then first Lieutenant, and company commander of ‘C’ Company, received an assignment to take the town of Climbach, France, then held by the enemy whose orders were to hold the town at all cost."[^1]
During this engagement, First Lieutenant Charles L. Thomas, the commander of Company C, displayed extraordinary heroism. Leading Third Platoon during the engagement, he deployed his guns on the reverse slope outside of town. Despite his injuries, he continued to lead his soldiers, until another officer was present to take over. His actions initially earned him the Distinguished Service Cross. Later this was upgraded to the Medal of Honor, which was awarded posthumously in 1997. The platoon likewise suffered and half of them became wounded or killed, while three of the four antitank guns were knocked out. 
For its performance, Third Platoon, Company C, the 614th Tank Destroyer Battalion became the first Black American unit to receive the Distinguished Unit Citation. This recognition was a testament to their tactical expertise, discipline, and unyielding courage under fire. Colonel Blackshear, the commander of the taskforce, wrote about it in a report: Colonel Blackshear even wrote about it in a report afterwards: “The unflinching determination of this group constituted the most magnificent display of mass heroism I have ever witnessed.”[^2]

### Black and white soldiers 
On 31 January 1946, the 614th Tank Destroyer Battalion was deactivated. Throughout its combat career, the soldiers of the 614th Tank Destroyer Battalion acquired the following decorations: one Distinguished Unit Citation, one Distinguished Service Cross, which was later upgraded to the Medal of Honor, eight Silver Star Medals and thirty Bronze Star Medals. Their story, however, goes beyond battlefield heroism. As participants in the “Double Victory” campaign, the men of the 614th fought not only against fascism abroad but also against the systemic racism and discrimination that pervaded the U.S. society. Their success challenged prevailing prejudices and played a significant role in shaping the postwar push for racial equality. Many white soldiers of the 103rd Infantry Division, to which the 614th Tank Destroyer Battalion had been attached for most of their combat career, came home with changed ideas of race and equality.
The 614th Tank Destroyer Battalion’s legacy endures today, as a symbol of excellence, sacrifice, and patriotism. Their contributions to World War II demonstrated the critical role of Black American soldiers in the Allied victory and inspired the eventual desegregation of the U.S. armed forces in 1948. Today, their story reminds us of the resilience and bravery of those who fought for a nation that did not fully recognize their worth, a powerful testament to their enduring fight for equality.
