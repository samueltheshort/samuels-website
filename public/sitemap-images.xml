          <image:caption>Ohrdruf camp was liberated on 4 April 1945 by the 4th Armored Division and the 89th Infantry Division. It would be the first camp to be liberated by the U.S. Army. On 12 April 1945, Generals Dwight D. Eisenhower, George S. Patton and Omar visited the camp. Eisenhower later said about his visit: “I made the visit deliberately, in order to be in a position to give first-hand evidence of these things if ever, in the future, there develops a tendency to charge these allegations merely to 'propaganda'." He later requested that journalists and members of Congress visited the camp so that they too would be a witness to the horrors of what happened at these places. Among those witnesses were also Black American soldiers.</image:caption>
