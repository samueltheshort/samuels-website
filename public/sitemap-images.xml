L to R: Private James Bryand, Sergeant Will L. Scott, Private First Class Dan Smith, and Corporal Woodrow George. This image also appeared in the Jackson Advocate of 4 September 1943, which alludes to an invasion of Germany. However, in September 1943, the Normandy landings were far in the future.</image:caption>
